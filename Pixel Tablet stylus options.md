So, the term I'm looking for is not Bluetooth but rather "Active". Anyways, doesn't matter too much cuz that's just a catch all term, and what really matters, is compatibility of the protocol between the tablet and pen.

After being very confused and [[Gemini - Pixel Tablet stylus options|complaining to Gemini about it]], I learned that all that mattered was that the stylus was compatible with the USI 2.0 protocol, (Universal Stylus Initiative) as that's what the Pixel Tablet supports.

From some Reddit browsing, it seems like USI kinda [niched itself in the low end cheap styluses product category](https://www.reddit.com/r/stylus/comments/oiquac/any_chance_we_see_usi_pens_on_windows_soon/). This also matches my experience of browsing the web for good options. Branding is all over the place, no dedicated reviews, no way to filter and sort by features. It's a mess. Even browsing the [official list of certified products](https://universalstylus.org/usi-certified-products/) from USI themselves is a stub cuz most products listed there don't show up on search results. From the same post, apparently EMR is a little better ? But it requires dedicated hardware, and currently, only the Samsung tablets have EMR digitizers along with Wacom tablets.

Either way, I'm stuck with that, so let's try to find the best options.
The most popular is one literally called [Penoval USI 2.0 Stylus](https://www.amazon.fr/Penoval-USI2-0-Chromebook-Pression-chromebook/dp/B0BNBGKM7W?source=ps-sl-shoppingads-lpcontext&ref_=fplfs&psc=1&smid=A1KEDDUG8EXXO2). No shit is shows up first in search results cuz the name of the product is the same as the protocol's. It's priced at 60 bucks. It has pressure sensitivity, palm rejection, good battery life, seemingly slim and good ergonomics, and magnetic attachement to compatible tablets, which Pixel Tablet doesn't. It doesn't have buttons thought. Nor does it offer tilt support.
